# Solutions of the binari 2 by 2 grid Sudoku on an available QPU on IBM

This project implements the **Qiskit Textbook** approach to solving a binary 2Ã—2 grid Sudoku using **Grover's algorithm**, and executes the circuit on a real quantum processor (QPU) available through **IBM Quantum Cloud**.

As you might expect, these devices are error propenses, so the results obtained from real hardware doesn't comper to the ideal simulated output.

## Tools:
- Python
- Qiskit and Matplotlib [IBM installation guide](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/docs/es/guides/install-qiskit)
- Pandas (Not necessary)
- [IBM cloud](https://cloud.ibm.com/registration?utm_content=quantum-trial&target=https%3A%2F%2Fquantum.cloud.ibm.com&error_uri=)
- [Set up account guide](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/docs/es/guides/cloud-setup)
